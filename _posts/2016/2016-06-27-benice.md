My daughter and I were playing in a play area at the mall. There was this other child who was being somewhat of a bully. This child was telling daughter who she was not allowed to play with. My daughter was in tears.

I thought to myself how we could turn this situation into a positive. “Why do bullies, well, bully?” Usually, it is because they are not happy. They are trying everything in their power to be noticed.

I called my daughter over to me. I told her to tell this child, “If you be nice, I will play with you.”  This child might just want to play with you.
She did as I said and I heard the child say “okay.” Within minutes, I heard tons of giggles as they made silly faces in front of the silly mirrors.

Fast Forward to weeks later.  We saw the same kids with the same mom.  Last time, the mom did nothing about her child bullying. This time, her true frustrations began to show. I heard her smack one of her children. Unfortunately, it was right in front of my daughter.  She kept yelling at her children, and they kept not responding and defying.
